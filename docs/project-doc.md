# Proposal: California Weather Data Analysis and Forecasting

## **Project Summary: Weather Data Analysis and Forecasting**

#### **Project Goals:**
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust system for forecasting weather conditions in California using historical weather data from 1970. Specifically, the project will focus on applying time series analysis to predict weather patterns and detect anomalies that may indicate significant shifts in climate or unexpected weather events. The system will be designed to support disaster preparedness efforts by providing early warnings for extreme weather events such as wildfires and droughts.

By concentrating on accurate weather predictions and anomaly detection, the project aims to offer valuable insights for both agricultural planning and climate monitoring tailored to geographical regions of California.

#### **Broader Impacts:**
This project has the potential to make a meaningful impact across various sectors:

1. **Agriculture:** Farmers and agricultural stakeholders can use accurate weather forecasts to optimize planting schedules, irrigation, and harvest times, thereby increasing crop yields and reducing losses due to unexpected weather events.
   
2. **Disaster Preparedness:** Accurate short-term weather predictions and anomaly detection can help governments and organizations prepare for and mitigate the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, and heatwaves.

3. **Climate Studies:** By analyzing long-term weather data, the project will contribute to understanding climate trends, which is critical for addressing climate change and its impacts on ecosystems and human societies.

#### **Data Sources:**

The project will utilize the following key data sources:

1. **NOAA Climate Data:** Provides comprehensive historical weather data, including temperature and precipitation records, essential for analyzing long-term climate trends and patterns in California.

2. **OpenWeatherMap API:** Offers real-time weather data, including current temperature and precipitation, crucial for accurate short-term weather forecasts and anomaly detection.

#### **Key Components:**
1. **Time Series Analysis:** Analyze historical weather data specific to California from 1970 to the present, focusing on key variables such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity. This analysis will identify long-term trends and seasonal patterns unique to different regions of California, such as coastal, inland, and mountainous areas. By understanding these patterns, we can establish a solid foundation for developing predictive models that account for California's diverse climate variations.

2. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Develop and train an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to forecast future weather conditions for California based on the identified trends and seasonal patterns. The model will specifically predict:
     - **Daily temperature fluctuations** (maximum and minimum temperatures) to assist in understanding heatwaves or cold spells.
     - **Precipitation patterns** to forecast the likelihood and intensity of rain, which is critical for water resource management and agriculture.
     - **Humidity levels** to predict changes that may impact comfort levels and agricultural practices.
   - The model will be trained on historical data, focusing on short-term predictions (e.g., up to 7 days ahead) while incorporating features such as time lags, seasonality indicators, and geographical information to enhance forecast accuracy tailored to specific regions within California.

## Basic Data Properties and Analysis Techniques

### **1. Data Overview and Summary Statistics**

**Objective:**
To provide an initial understanding of the datasets by summarizing key characteristics and overall distributions of the data.

**Techniques:**
- **Descriptive Statistics:**
  - **Mean, Median, and Mode:** Calculate these central tendency measures for continuous variables such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity to understand the average conditions.
  - **Standard Deviation and Variance:** Measure the variability of weather variables to assess the spread and dispersion of the data.
  - **Min and Max Values:** Identify the range of weather conditions to understand the extremes observed in the dataset.

- **Distribution Analysis:**
  - **Histograms:** Create histograms to visualize the frequency distribution of continuous variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation).
  - **Box Plots:** Use box plots to visualize the spread, central tendency, and potential outliers in the data.

### **2. Temporal Analysis**

**Objective:**
To analyze how weather variables change over time and identify notable patterns or trends.

**Techniques:**

- **Seasonal Decomposition (STL Decomposition):**
  - **Implementation Plan:** Use the STL decomposition method to break down the historical weather data into seasonal, trend, and residual components. This will involve:
    - Selecting a suitable time frame (e.g., daily or monthly data) to capture seasonal variations accurately.
    - Applying the STL decomposition function from libraries such as `statsmodels` in Python to visualize and analyze each component. 
    - Assessing the seasonal patterns across different regions in California to identify variations in temperature and precipitation that align with specific seasons.

- **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA):**
  - **Implementation Plan:** Fit ARIMA models to forecast future weather conditions by:
    - Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to determine the appropriate differencing needed for stationarity.
    - Using autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots to identify the optimal order of the ARIMA model (p, d, q).
    - Training the ARIMA model on the historical data, focusing on key weather variables such as temperature and precipitation.
    - Validating the model’s performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and comparing predicted values against actual observations for accuracy.


### **3. Anomaly Detection**

**Objective:**
To identify unusual or extreme weather events that deviate significantly from historical norms.

**Techniques:**

- **Z-Score Analysis:**
  - **Implementation Plan:** 
    - Calculate the mean and standard deviation of key weather variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation) using historical data from California.
    - For each data point in the dataset, compute the Z-score using the formula:
      \[
      Z = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma}
      \]
      where \(X\) is the data point, \(\mu\) is the mean, and \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation.
    - Identify anomalies as data points with Z-scores exceeding a threshold (e.g., ±3), indicating significant deviations from normal weather conditions. 
    - Visualize the results using time series plots to highlight the identified anomalies and their corresponding dates.

- **Interquartile Range (IQR) Method:**
  - **Implementation Plan:**
    - Calculate the first (Q1) and third quartiles (Q3) of the weather data distribution to determine the IQR:
      \[
      IQR = Q3 - Q1
      \]
    - Define lower and upper bounds for detecting outliers:
      - Lower bound: \(Q1 - 1.5 \times IQR\)
      - Upper bound: \(Q3 + 1.5 \times IQR\)
    - Flag any data points that fall outside these bounds as potential anomalies. 
    - Apply this method to each weather variable and visualize the identified outliers using box plots or scatter plots to provide context for the extreme values.
