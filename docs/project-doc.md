# Proposal: California Weather Data Analysis and Forecasting

## **Project Summary: Weather Data Analysis and Forecasting**

#### **Project Goals:**
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust system for forecasting weather conditions in California using historical weather data from 1970. Specifically, the project will focus on applying time series analysis to predict weather patterns and detect anomalies that may indicate significant shifts in climate or unexpected weather events. The system will be designed to support disaster preparedness efforts by providing early warnings for extreme weather events such as wildfires and droughts.

By concentrating on accurate weather predictions and anomaly detection, the project aims to offer valuable insights for both agricultural planning and climate monitoring tailored to geographical regions of California.

#### **Broader Impacts:**
This project has the potential to make a meaningful impact across various sectors:

1. **Agriculture:** Farmers and agricultural stakeholders can use accurate weather forecasts to optimize planting schedules, irrigation, and harvest times, thereby increasing crop yields and reducing losses due to unexpected weather events.
   
2. **Disaster Preparedness:** Accurate short-term weather predictions and anomaly detection can help governments and organizations prepare for and mitigate the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, and heatwaves.

3. **Climate Studies:** By analyzing long-term weather data, the project will contribute to understanding climate trends, which is critical for addressing climate change and its impacts on ecosystems and human societies.

#### **Data Sources:**

The project will utilize the following key data sources:

1. **NOAA Climate Data:** Provides comprehensive historical weather data, including temperature and precipitation records, essential for analyzing long-term climate trends and patterns in California.

2. **OpenWeatherMap API:** Offers real-time weather data, including current temperature and precipitation, crucial for accurate short-term weather forecasts and anomaly detection.

#### **Key Components:**
