## **Preprocessing Steps**

To ensure that the datasets used in this project are clean, consistent, and ready for analysis, several preprocessing steps are necessary. These steps will address potential issues such as missing data, inconsistencies, and the need for data transformation. Below is a list of the major preprocessing steps, along with explanations of why each step is important:

#### **1. Data Cleaning**
   - **Step:** Remove or fill missing values.
   - **Explanation:** Weather datasets often contain missing values due to sensor malfunctions or data transmission issues. Missing data can lead to inaccurate analysis and predictions. Techniques such as interpolation, forward/backward filling, or the use of mean/mode imputation will be applied to handle missing values.
  
   - **Step:** Correct or remove outliers.
   - **Explanation:** Outliers can skew the results of analysis and machine learning models. It is important to identify and correct or remove these outliers, especially if they are due to data entry errors or sensor faults, to ensure the data reflects true weather patterns.

#### **2. Data Transformation**
   - **Step:** Normalize or standardize the data.
   - **Explanation:** Weather data variables like temperature, wind speed, and precipitation may have different units or scales. Normalization (scaling data to a range) or standardization (scaling data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1) ensures that all features contribute equally to the analysis and machine learning models.
  
   - **Step:** Convert categorical variables into numerical ones.
   - **Explanation:** If the dataset includes categorical variables (e.g., weather conditions like "rainy," "sunny"), these need to be converted into numerical formats (e.g., using one-hot encoding) so they can be used in machine learning models.

#### **3. Time Series Preparation**
   - **Step:** Ensure data is uniformly time-stamped.
   - **Explanation:** Time series analysis requires that data points are uniformly spaced in time. Any irregularities in the time-stamps (e.g., missing days or hours) need to be addressed, possibly by resampling the data or interpolating missing time points.
  
   - **Step:** Create lag features.
   - **Explanation:** Lag features (previous time steps' data) are often useful in time series forecasting models. Creating these features allows the model to learn from previous weather conditions to predict future ones.

#### **4. Data Integration**
   - **Step:** Merge data from multiple sources.
   - **Explanation:** Since the project will use data from multiple sources (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, NOAA), it’s important to merge these datasets into a unified format. This step involves aligning data on time-stamps and locations to ensure consistency across different sources.

   - **Step:** Handle discrepancies between datasets.
   - **Explanation:** Different datasets may have varying formats, units, or reporting standards. These discrepancies need to be reconciled to ensure that the combined dataset is coherent. For example, temperature might be reported in Celsius in one dataset and Fahrenheit in another, requiring conversion to a common unit.

#### **5. Feature Engineering**
   - **Step:** Create new features based on existing data.
   - **Explanation:** Feature engineering involves creating new variables that can help improve the performance of machine learning models. For example, combining temperature and humidity to create a "heat index" feature, or calculating rolling averages of temperature over the past week.
  
   - **Step:** Dimensionality reduction (if necessary).
   - **Explanation:** If the dataset has a large number of features, dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be applied to reduce the feature set while retaining most of the variance in the data. This step can improve model performance and reduce computation time.

#### **6. Data Splitting**
   - **Step:** Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
   - **Explanation:** To ensure that the machine learning models generalize well to unseen data, the dataset will be split into training (for model training), validation (for hyperparameter tuning), and test sets (for final evaluation). Care will be taken to maintain the temporal order of data in time series analysis to prevent data leakage.
