## Data Analysis and Algorithms

In this project, we focus on predicting and analyzing temperature data across various cities using advanced machine learning algorithms, including **Prophet**, **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**, and traditional regression models like **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, and **K-Nearest Neighbors**. Each algorithm was chosen based on its strengths in handling time-series data and regression tasks. Below, I describe the types of analyses conducted and the specific algorithms used, their logic, inputs, and expected outputs.

### 1. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Network**

- **Algorithmic Properties**: 
  LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that excels at modeling sequential data and capturing long-term dependencies. It is particularly suited for time-series forecasting due to its ability to retain information from previous time steps using its memory cells and gates (input, forget, and output).
  
- **Inputs**: 
  The input to the LSTM model consists of a series of temperature values for each city, prepared as sequences of 60 time steps. The input data is scaled using **MinMaxScaler** to ensure consistent training performance.

- **Outputs**: 
  The output is a predicted temperature value for the next time step in the sequence. For multi-step forecasting, the model iteratively uses predicted values to forecast future temperatures over several time steps.

- **Expected Analysis**: 
  The LSTM model was trained to predict the short-term temperature patterns for multiple cities. The performance of the model was evaluated using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, and **R-squared (RÂ²)** metrics, achieving strong results on the test data. A key finding is the modelâ€™s ability to capture non-linear relationships and long-term dependencies in temperature patterns, providing highly accurate forecasts.

### 2. **Prophet Model for Time-Series Forecasting**

- **Algorithmic Properties**: 
  **Prophet** is an additive model developed by Facebook, designed specifically for forecasting time-series data with trends and seasonality. It is robust to missing data and can capture daily, weekly, and yearly seasonality with minimal parameter tuning. The model also handles holiday effects and trend changepoints automatically.

- **Inputs**: 
  The input data for Prophet consists of two columns: `ds` (date) and `y` (temperature). The model uses historical temperature data to learn the overall trend, daily patterns, and seasonal variations.

- **Outputs**: 
  Prophet outputs the predicted temperature for each future date, along with confidence intervals. Additionally, the model decomposes the forecast into **trend**, **yearly seasonality**, and **daily seasonality** components.

- **Expected Analysis**: 
  Prophet was used to detect long-term trends and seasonal patterns in the temperature data for each city. The analysis showed clear seasonal trends (e.g., higher temperatures during summer months) and identified potential changepoints where the overall temperature trend shifted. The performance metrics indicated that Prophet was effective in capturing both trends and short-term fluctuations in the data.

### 3. **Traditional Regression Models**

#### **Linear Regression**
- **Algorithmic Properties**: 
  **Linear Regression** models the relationship between the input features (e.g., temperature, visibility, dew point) and the target variable (future temperature) by fitting a linear equation. It assumes a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs.

- **Inputs**: 
  Features such as latitude, longitude, visibility, dew point, and previous temperature values were used as inputs for predicting future temperatures.

- **Outputs**: 
  The predicted temperature value at the next time step.

- **Expected Analysis**: 
  Linear regression provides a baseline performance for forecasting temperature. While it is less flexible than other models, it helps to understand the basic linear relationships in the data. However, due to the non-linear nature of temperature trends, this model showed lower performance compared to more advanced algorithms like LSTM.

#### **Random Forest and Gradient Boosting**
- **Algorithmic Properties**: 
  **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** are ensemble learning methods that combine multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. Random Forest works by averaging predictions from multiple independent decision trees, while Gradient Boosting trains trees sequentially, focusing on correcting the errors made by previous trees.

- **Inputs**: 
  Similar to linear regression, these models take in multiple weather-related features (e.g., latitude, visibility, temperature) as inputs to predict the next temperature value.

- **Outputs**: 
  The models output a predicted temperature value for each time step.

- **Expected Analysis**: 
  Both Random Forest and Gradient Boosting showed strong performance on the temperature prediction task, with lower errors compared to Linear Regression. These models are well-suited for capturing complex interactions between the input features and are robust to overfitting due to their ensemble nature. Gradient Boosting, in particular, demonstrated strong results with fine-tuned hyperparameters.

### 4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Algorithmic Properties**: 
  **KNN** is a simple, non-parametric algorithm that makes predictions by averaging the outcomes of the K nearest neighbors in the feature space. It is a memory-based model that relies on the similarity between observations.

- **Inputs**: 
  The same set of weather-related features used in the other regression models (e.g., temperature, latitude, visibility) were input into the KNN algorithm.

- **Outputs**: 
  The predicted temperature value, based on the average temperature values of the nearest neighbors.

- **Expected Analysis**: 
  KNN performed reasonably well but was less accurate compared to ensemble models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. Its performance is highly dependent on the choice of `K` and the distance metric, and it tends to struggle with large datasets and high-dimensional feature spaces.

- **Output**: Predicted temperature values.
- **Results**:
    - **Random Forest**: MAE = 0.1335, RMSE = 0.2126, RÂ² = 0.9998 (some signs of overfitting).
    - **Linear Regression**: MAE = 0.2181, RMSE = 0.3161, RÂ² = 0.9995.
    - **Gradient Boosting**: MAE = 0.2672, RMSE = 0.3536, RÂ² = 0.9994.
    - **KNN**: MAE = 0.6308, RMSE = 1.3292, RÂ² = 0.9912 (clear signs of overfitting).
  
- **Visualization**:
    - Performance metrics (MAE, RMSE) were plotted for each model.
    - Actual vs predicted plots and residual plots were created for all models, allowing comparison of the models' predictive accuracy.

#### 4. **Multi-City Prophet Forecasting**
- **Process**:
    - We extended the Prophet model to forecast temperatures for multiple cities individually.
    - For each city, the model was trained and used to predict the next 365 days of temperatures.
    - Cities with fewer than 30 observations were excluded to ensure reliable predictions.
    - Performance metrics for each cityâ€™s model were calculated, and all forecasts were combined into a single DataFrame for easy analysis.

- **Results**:
    - Detailed performance metrics were recorded for each city, providing insights into how the model performed across different geographical locations.
  
- **Visualization**:
    - Forecasts for each city were visualized using Prophetâ€™s built-in plotting functions.

### Conclusion:
- **LSTM** performed exceptionally well on sequential temperature data, showing strong predictive capabilities and minimal overfitting.
- **Prophet** was useful for capturing long-term trends and seasonal patterns in city-specific temperature data, though its overall predictive accuracy was lower than LSTM.
- **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** performed well, but Random Forest showed slight signs of overfitting, which could be improved with further tuning.
- **KNN** displayed significant overfitting, performing well on the training set but poorly on the test set.

# Visualization
## Visualization Plan
<!--- List and explain what types of plots you plan to provide and what you are trying to show through the diagrams. You should explore the best way to visualize the information and message based on the lectures on visualization and related topics. It is required to have at least two interactive graphing and five static plots. -->

## Web Page Plan
<!--- Explain how many pages you will have in total and what content will be shown in each page. (Each diagram discussed above should be given a proper location in this section. Also, it is required to have (1) "Project Objective" page, which explains the main goals and data sources, and (2) "Analytical Methods" page, where you explain the major techniques used in the project and provide further references. -->
